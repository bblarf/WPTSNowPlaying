# WPTS Now Playing
---
## What does this even do?
  - All this project does is update what is playing on the University of Pittsburgh's student run radio station, WPTS Radio.
## That's it?
  - Yes.
## Why did you make it?
  - This project was used for WPTS Radio's 24 Hour Marathon event during the live streamed portion. In between hours, we had a splash screen on the livestream that updated with what was playing at that time, and this app was used to display that information.
